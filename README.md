📁 Project: MLOps Mental Wellness Predictor
📦 Repo Structure Generator Script

🔍 Overview:
This script sets up the boilerplate structure for the `mlops-wellness-score` project.
The project aims to predict both the **Happiness Index** and **Anxiety Score** using a
multi-output regression model, based on user lifestyle inputs such as:

- Sleep hours
- Exercise frequency
- Diet quality
- Social interaction level
- Stress level
- Demographics (age group, gender)

🔧 MLOps Features:
- Modular code architecture with `src/` folder
- Separate folders for components, config, pipeline, and utilities
- YAML files for schema, hyperparameters, and config management
- Flask app support via `app.py` and HTML templates
- CI/CD-ready structure with `.github/workflows/`

📂 Auto-generated Structure Includes:
- `src/datascience/`: Core package
    - `components/`: Data ingestion, transformation, model training
    - `pipeline/`: Training & prediction pipeline entry points
    - `config/`: Configuration loading logic
    - `utils/`: Common utility functions
    - `entity/`: Configuration and data schema objects
    - `constants/`: Global constants
- `config/config.yaml`: Project-level configurations
- `params.yaml`: Model training hyperparameters
- `schema.yaml`: Input schema validation
- `main.py`: Pipeline entry script
- `Dockerfile`: Containerization support
- `app.py`: Flask API script
- `templates/index.html`: Web app frontend
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD placeholder
- `research/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation

📌 How to Use:
1. Run this script to initialize the project structure
2. Fill in your components and logic incrementally
3. Connect everything in `main.py` and `app.py`
4. Optionally add Docker, GitHub Actions, and MLflow tracking
